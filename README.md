# Quick Fry, Puck 'n Bowl for Ion Fury

An AutoHotkey script that allows quick firing either your bowling bombs or cluster pucks, with double tapping the key allowing quick firing of each bomb's secondary.

### Default keybinds

`g` & `Mouse4` Quick throw a Cluster Puck. Double tap to arm the secondary before throwing.

`ctrl+g` Ctrl & the currently bound cluster puck key will toggle arming the secondary on a new puck after throwing the previous one, and before swapping back to your previous weapon.
